# 🧠 DevOps Learning Mind Maps

Welcome to my personal DevOps learning repo — a living workspace where I document everything I'm learning about Docker, CI/CD, infrastructure, and cloud through visual **mind maps** and quick-reference guides.

## 🚀 Why This Repo Exists

As a DevOps learner, I often found myself needing quick refreshers before deploying or configuring something. This repo serves as:

- ✅ A **revision tool** before real-world deployments
- 🧭 A **knowledge map** as I explore new stacks and tools
- 🔁 A **work in progress** — I’ll keep updating as I learn
